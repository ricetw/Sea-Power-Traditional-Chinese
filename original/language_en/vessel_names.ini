Much of the space was then dedicated to creating a landing pad that could operate the uncrewed DASH ASW helicopter. In addition the ships received upgraded sensors, such as the SPG-55B radar, and the AN/SQS-26 sonar.

DefaultDescription=The first nuclear powered aircraft carrier in the US Navy, the USS Enterprise was originally planned as the first of six ships, but her sisters were cancelled due to cost. Consequently she had a number features unique among all cold war carriers. This included the temperamental, but extremely capable SCANFAR phased array radar, that could greatly enhance a battlegroup’s scanning coverage. At the same time, it received a modest defensive missile suite late in the day, consisting of two Mk.26 launchers carrying Sparrow III missiles. In most other respects, such as air wing capacity and operations, it is essentially the same as other super carriers like the later Nimitz class.

Their large size is made necessary by the need to accommodate a large battery of anti-ship missiles as well as an area-defence surface-to-air missile system with several close-in defences as backup.\n\nThough fitted with advanced sonar and stand-off ASW weapons, these ships generally operate as flagships of surface warfare groups protected by dedicated ASW ships.

DefaultDescription=Known in Russian as the Storm Petrel (Project 1135M) the Krivak-classes were intended as successors to the Riga-class frigates. They are almost immediately recognisable due to the "Hot Dog Pack" of the SS-N-14 Silex on the bow. The Krivak II differs from the Krivak I in having a heavier gun armament, which gives these boats a pronounced trim to the stern.

DefaultDescription=The Echo II is an improved version of the Echo I-class first-generation cruise missile submarine. Because the SS-N-3 requires midcourse guidance updates throughout the entire flight envelope, the launching boat has to stay exposed on the surface, making them vulnerable targets. The large cut-outs behind the launchers also makes these boats exceptionally noisy.

Intended for the pro-submarine mission, these ships carry an impressive array of anti-ship and anti-air missiles in addition to extensive ASW capabilities.
